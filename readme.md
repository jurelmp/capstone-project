## Alumni Tracer System

Alumni are the rich source of feedback for improvements in the course curriculum, teaching, research, extension, and networking but the current Alumni system only focuses the employability of the graduates to measure the extent of professional and academic careers pursued by the graduates after gaining knowledge and skill but the system does not covered the curriculum development and skills inventory.
On the other hand, existing alumni system is developed to facilitate networking between the alumni and their respective university, but the current system is not being used by the majority of the alumni for many reasons. A simple glance at the current alumni system can give us a hint how simple its content was. The current alumni system do not provide a comprehensive database for storing of Alumni data for quick and efficient retrieval which made tracking and contacting alumni an extremely time consuming operation; moreover, for the basic requirements it does not generate report and cannot filtered data. Therefore, it is really important for the university to also focus on the alumni system that do not have include those features, which would also find ways to enhance their growth and development.
